  If you don't have Err 44 and your cartridge indicates a shift which doesn't
  happen, there is a high chance that you have a miss-aligned hub gear.

# Hub gear miss-alignment

Your eShifter does try to realign itself on every startup. If you have an extreme miss-alignment of your central shift gear, the automated process will fail leaving you with an inoperable eShifter.&#x20;

Don't worry, the fix is quite easy.&#x20;



1. Remove the rear wheel with the eShifter, following this video by Vanmoof.\

1. In the video you can already see the auto-alignment process. If your eShifters alignment process fails, you need to disassemble the eShifter.
2. Remove the 4 screws holding the shifter together, and split it apart along the seam. There is an easy location at the bottom of the shifter, where you can wedge in a small screwdriver.
3. Lay the eShifter flat on a table and slowly lift off the front shell.&#x20;
4. You'll see the eShifter PCB and the central gear on the left side of the shifter. Take a look at the ring around the main gear. Notice the small black markings in the ring? These are small magnets, which are supposed to trigger the hall-effect sensors on the eShifters board.&#x20;
5. That your shifters alignment process failed, can basically have two causes:&#x20;
   1. one or both of your hall-effect sensors are faulty.
   2. the main gear was aligned so bad, that it triggered the expected response from the hall-effect sensors before reaching its correct position.
6. If your sensors are indeed faulty, you'll need to replace them with the correct hall effect sensor type and try again.&#x20;
7. If your main gear is missaligned, you can fix the shifter by taking out one of the smaller gears of the shifter, so that the main gear can "freely" rotate (it's pretty tightly pressed into the bushings, so it might take a bit of force to spin it, but it should be able to spin without affecting the gears all the way back to the motor). Then rotate the main gear until the small dot on the gear aligns with the dot on the shifters housing.&#x20;
8. Reassemble the shifter.
9. Plug the shifter back into the bike and turn on the bike.
10. You should see the shifter rotate from its position and realign itself successfully.
11. You can now turn off the bike again, unplug the shifter and reattach it to the wheel, as described in the video "Replacing the eShifter" linked above.
12. Finally reattach the wheel to your bike, as described in the video below:

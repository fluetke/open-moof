  The following how-to by reddit user /u/wiliv explains how to set the eShifter
  and rear hub to a fixed 3rd gear, in case you want to ride your bike as
  "fixie" without using the eShifter going forward.

# Set shifter to fixed 3rd gear

1. Removing the rear wheel and e-shifter: I accomplished both of these tasks using the tools provided with my bike along with 4 mm and 2.5 mm hex keys. VanMoof has YouTube videos for both of these tasks and I was able to follow them without issue.
2. Taking apart the e-shifter: it is held together with four screws that require a 2 mm hex key. The two halves are sealed with a rubber gasket and you'll need to use some sort of shim to separate them (I used a plastic bicycle tire remover shim). Separating them with the corded side up will yield the layout you see an image 1. Again, there are videos on YouTube of folks doing this if you want to see how it's done.
3. Positioning the e-shifter in third gear: With the electric motor separated from the gear train, I was able to easily rotate the output spline to the third gear position, image 2. I then put the two halves back together and then separated them again, this time with the corded side down so that all of the components were laying in the same half of the housing, image 3.
4. Aligning hub: The black gear on the hub is the input to the hub shifter. The range of motion between first and fourth gear is about 90°, with approximately 30° increments between each gear. I rotated it back and forth across its full range of motion to get familiar with it and then tried to place it at approximately the third gear position (60° counterclockwise from first gear). The axle must be held in place while you do this else the whole assembly will spin. I then placed the e-shifter onto the hub like you see in image 3 and verified that the spline of the e-shifter meshed with the hub. Lastly, I took the outer shell of the e-shifter and slid it over the axle and aligned the two halves of the e-shifter like you see in image 5, eventually snugging them together once they were aligned. This was probably more tedious than it needed to be, but it verified both that the spline had proper engagement and that the relative position of the axle and the hub gear were correct.
5. Reassembly: I removed the e-shifter from the hub and put it back together with its four screws. I then reattach the e-shifter and reinstalled the rear wheel, again following the YouTube videos provided by VanMoof.
6. Testing: My biggest concern with this alteration is accidentally positioning the hub shifter between gears. With the bike upside down, I hand peddled it and listened for any abnormal clicking or grinding noises. Hearing none, I took it for a test drive to confirm that I could comfortably pedal at the top speed as well as comfortably accelerate from a stop with the aid of the boost button.

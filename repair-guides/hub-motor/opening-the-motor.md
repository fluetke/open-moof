# Opening the motor

Open the motor is quite easy, you'll need a Torx wrench and a Phillips screwdriver.

1. With the front hub removed, place the wheel on its side, the side with screws facing upward.
2. Remove the screws securing the brake disc to the wheel and put it aside.
3. Remove the screws around the outer side of the hub with the Torx wrench, opening the screws on opposing sides in pairs, to even out the pressure along the hub.
4. With the screws removed carefully slide the cap upwards to open up the motor housing. It should've come apart already through the pressure from the motor pushing against it.
5. You can now remove the motor from it's housing, by pulling it up and carefully guiding the motor cable through the rear hole of the hub.

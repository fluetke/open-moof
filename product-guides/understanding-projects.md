## Replacing the cable harness

To replace the harness, you need to remove EVERY SINGLE PART from your bike.

Start by removing the rear wheel and eShifter as described in [making-a-post.md](making-a-post.md "mention")

Proceed by removing the front wheel and hub motor as describe in [removing-the-front-wheel-and-hub-motor.md](../repair-guides/hub-motor/removing-the-front-wheel-and-hub-motor.md "mention")

With booth wheels removed, go ahead and remove the saddle (easy done using the torx 0 screw on the seatpost with the torx wrench in your Vanmoof toolkit).

After you've removed the saddle it's time to slide out the smart cartridge, the heart of your smartbike. To do so, remove the size 8 SecurityTorx screw below the upper crossbar. Pay attention there is one small antenna plate that needs to be removed as well, it is held on with 2 silver Security Torx screws. Dont remove the frontmost pair of torx screws yet. Once all screws are removed slide the cartridge out of the back of the bike.

Next, either hang your bike from the ceiling or turn it upside down to access the battery.

Removing the battery is quite easy, there are 3 security torx screws holding the battery cover plate onto the bottom frame. Remove the side and the center screw and you will be able to remove the cover plate. Don't leave the center screw in and think you can pull out the battery with the plate attached. The wire for the pedal-sensor runs right in between the plate and the actual battery, you'll risk damaging it. Fully remove all three screws before you remove the plate.&#x20;

With the plate removed you'll see the actual battery and the sensor cable running across it.

Lightly pull on the sensor cable to reveal the sensor connector.

Disconnect the pedal sensor and move the wire out of the way. Then lift up the small handle and pull out the battery. This shouldn't require much force, if the battery is stuck, you might want try to put just the center screw back and use pliers or a wrench to pull the battery out by holding onto the screw. Be careful, the heatset insert for the screw will give in after a while of prying, after which you wont be able to pull the battery out at all.

After removing the battery you'll be able to reach the wires for kicklock and eShifter.

Before you try to pull the wires out, first remove the kicklock, as described in Vanmoofs Video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQxvvyrIWjA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQxvvyrIWjA\&pp=ygUUdmFuIG1vb2YgczMga2lja2xvY2s%3D)

When this is done you can slowly pull out the wires going to kicklock and the eShifter.&#x20;

Next, remove the cable guide inside the frame. There should be a dark-grey plastic piece in the battery compartment which you can slide out by slowly pulling on it with a pair of pliers.

Next, turn your bike back around, if you've flipped it previously, or lower it a bit if hung from the ceiling. You'll want to remove the handlebar and front fork next.

To remove the handlebar, unscrew the two hex-screws you've used to set the handlebar height and secure it to the bike when you first received your Vanmoof. Then lift up the handlebar and remove the spacers you might've installed. Be carefully when pulling up the handlebar as there are two small wires running inside of it. Those connect your bell and boost buttons to the rest of the bike. You can disconnect them with two small plugs on the cables. Just make note of which cable goes where.

Next disconnect the two hydraulic brake lines going to your brake levers, careful, this will spill a bit of oil, so make sure to keep a towel nearby. Wrap them in a bit of plastic to prevent further spills and protect the ends of the lines. You can now fully remove the handebar.

Afterwards remove the screw in the central pinion of the front fork, but be careful when doing so, as this screw keeps your bikes front fork in place. After removing the screw, slide up the metal sleeve that goes over your front fork. Your fork might fall out any moment now.

To remove the front fork, slowly push down on the forks pinion, while turning the fork left and right. You should be feeling the fork come loose slowly. At this point, STOP!&#x20;

Before going any further make sure you have a bit of string ready. Tie the string around the motor plug and the two small wires coming out of the top of the fork. Then slowly push the motor-plug and the small cables into the fork, to enable them to slide out easily when you continue pushing down the fork. To make things a little easier and increase your visibility during the next steps, you might want to also remove the headlight, this will give you access to the back of the cartridge and battery sockets and allow you to see more clearly how your removal operation goes.

Continue turning and pushing the fork until it fully drops out of your bikes frame.

You should now have an empty frame with three wires dangling out of the lower front of your bike.

Time to tackle the main task, removing the socket and cable harness. You've already prepared the bottom cables, good on you. Now is the time to remove the remaining screws from below the top crossbar. These securtiy torx are in a tight spot, you might want to combine a bit and a wrench to get these out, they are holding the cartridge socket in place. Repeat this process with the two screws on the bottom crossbar, which hold the battery connector in place.

With all four screws removed you should be able to pull the complete socket out of the lower front of your bike, below where the headlight used to be.

Now simply repeate the process in reverse to insert the new harness. ;-P

Some tips:&#x20;

First of all - Putting the harness back is nowhere near as easy as taking it out.

When inserting the cartridge socket and battery socket, hold them in place by using two of your longest fingers through the headlight hole and/or the bottom hole where the fork goes.

You might want to prepare the wires for the battery and the brakelines by 3d printing fitting inserts for the battery compartment which will hold the brake line in place, next to the cable harness, so you can more easily insert the plastic shim that holds all of this in place later.

If you need to use brute force for something, you're doing it wrong.

Take a break, go boxing to get rid of your rising aggression and try again the next day. And believe me, you will get quite aggressive when trying to replace this pos without a manual.
